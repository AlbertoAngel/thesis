%%%% Tweak float placements

% Alter some LaTeX defaults for better treatment of figures:
    %   General parameters, for ALL pages:
    \renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.85}   % max fraction of floats at top
    \renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.6} % max fraction of floats at bottom

    %   Parameters for TEXT pages (not float pages):
    \setcounter{topnumber}{2}
    \setcounter{bottomnumber}{2}
    \setcounter{totalnumber}{4}     % 2 may work better
    \setcounter{dbltopnumber}{2}    % for 2-column pages
    \renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.66}    % fit big float above 2-col. text
    \renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.15}  % allow minimal text w. figs

    %   Parameters for FLOAT pages (not text pages):
    \renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.66} % require fuller float pages
    % N.B.: floatpagefraction MUST be less than topfraction !!
    \renewcommand{\dblfloatpagefraction}{0.66}  % require fuller float pages

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%% Use packages

\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsthm}

%%% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx}

%%% for comments

\usepackage{multirow}

% Longtable lets you have tables that span multiple pages.
\usepackage{longtable}

% Booktabs produces far nicer tables than the standard LaTeX tables.
\usepackage{booktabs}

%set parameters for longtable:
% default caption width is 4in for longtable, but wider for normal tables
